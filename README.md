# openFPM (Open Framework for Particle and Mesh-based simulations)
is a scalable, flexible, and high-performance C++ framework designed for particle and mesh-based numerical simulations. It supports hybrid parallelism (MPI + OpenMP), dynamic load balancing, and offers extensible data structures and solvers for scientific computing.

Key features include:

Efficient handling of particle and mesh data
Support for multi-physics simulations
Scalability across large HPC systems
Modular design for easy extension and customization
Ideal for researchers and engineers working on computational physics, fluid dynamics, and other numerical modeling fields.
